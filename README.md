# Covid Data Exploration Using SQL/Tableau
This repository contains the data source (owid-covid-date.csv) from OurWorldinDAta.org and the Tableau Dashboard I created

Questions that I solved:
1. What are the Global Numbers with total cases, total deaths, and death percentage?
2. What are the global death counts bewteen each continent?
3. What percentage of the population was infected with Covid-19 by country?
